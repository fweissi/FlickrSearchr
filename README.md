#Welcome CVS Reviewers
###My name is Keith Weiss and I have prepared an application for you.

I have created an app called ***Flickr Searchr*** that uses Flickr to download images and save them on device. This app uses SwiftData and two plug-ins that I have never used before. I used ***Papyrus*** as a standardized HTTPClient to access the Flickr public API. I used ***Kingfisher*** to download images. Given more time, I could certainly add more polish and accessibility features. I ran out of time to do any unit testing. Also, I used an application called Ducky to create my JSON Response code. The commented out code is code from Ducky, that I chose not to use.

I look forward to your comments.

Keith
